(** Rustc inserts a lot of drops before the assignments.

    We consider those drops are part of the assignment, and splitting the
    drop and the assignment is problematic for us because it can introduce
    [âŠ¥] under borrows. For instance, we encountered situations like the
    following one:
    
    {[
      drop( *x ); // Illegal! Inserts a âŠ¥ under a borrow
      *x = move ...;
    ]}

    Rem.: we don't use this anymore

(** This pass slightly restructures the control-flow to remove the need to
    merge branches during the symbolic execution in some quite common cases
    where doing a merge is actually not necessary and leads to an ugly translation.

    For instance, it performs the following transformation:
    {[
      if b {
          var@0 := &mut *x;
      }
      else {
          var@0 := move y;
      }
      return;

      ~~>

      if b {
          var@0 := &mut *x;
          return;
      }
      else {
          var@0 := move y;
          return;
      }
    ]}

    This way, the translated body doesn't have an intermediate assignment,
    for the `if ... then ... else ...` expression (together with a backward
    function).

    More precisly, we move (and duplicate) a statement happening after a branching
    inside the branches if:
    - this statement ends with [return] or [panic]
    - this statement is only made of a sequence of nops, assignments (with some
      restrictions on the rvalue), fake reads, drops (usually, returns will be
      followed by such statements)
