  (* Define a (group of mutually recursive) function(s) which uses an error
     monad and is potentially divergent.

     We encode divergence in such a way that we don't have to prove that the
     functions we define terminate *upon defining them*, and can do those proofs
     in an extrinsic way later. It works as follows.

     Let's say you want to define the following “even” and “odd” functions
     which operate on *integers*:

     {[
       even (i : int) : bool result = if i = 0 then Return T else odd (i - 1) /\

       odd (i : int) : bool result = if i = 0 then Return F else even (i - 1)
     ]}

     It is easy to prove that the functions terminate provided the input is >= 0,
     but it would require to be able to define those functions in the first place!

     {!DefineDev} consequently does the following.

     It first defines versions of “even” and “odd” which use fuel:
     {[
       even___fuel (n : num) (i : int) : bool result =
         case n of 0 => Diverge
         | SUC m => if i = 0 then Return T else odd___fuel m (i - 1) /\

       odd___fuel (n : num) (i : int) : bool result =
         case n of 0 => Diverge
         | SUC m => if i = 0 then Return F else even___fuel m (i - 1)
     ]}

     Those functions trivially terminate.

     Then, provided we have the following auxiliary definition:
     {[
       is_diverge (r: 'a result) : bool = case r of Diverge => T | _ => F
     ]}

     we can define the following predicates, which tell us whether “even___fuel”
     and “odd___fuel” terminate on some given inputs:
     {[
       even___P i n = ~(is_diverge (even___fuel n i)) /\

       odd___P i n = ~(is_diverge (odd___fuel n i))
     ]}

     We can finally define “even” and “odd” as follows. We use the excluded
     middle to test whether there exists some fuel on which the function
     terminates: if there exists such fuel, we call the "___fuel" versions
     of “even” and “odd” with it (we use the least upper bound, to be more
     precise). Otherwise, we simply return “Diverge”.
     {[
       even i =
         if (?n. even___P i n) then even___fuel ($LEAST (even___P i)) i
         else Diverge /\

       odd i =
         if (?n. odd___P i n) then odd___fuel ($LEAST (odd___P i)) i
         else Diverge
     ]}

     The definitions above happen to satisfy the rewriting theorem we want:
     {[
       even (i : int) : bool result = if i = 0 then Return T else odd (i - 1) /\

       odd (i : int) : bool result = if i = 0 then Return F else even (i - 1)
     ]}

     Moreover, if we prove a lemma which states that they don't evaluate to
     “Diverge” on some given inputs (trivial recursion if we take “i >= 0”
     and reuse the rewriting theorem just above), then we effectively proved
     that the functions terminate on those inputs.

     Remark:
     =======
     {!DefineDiv} introduces all the auxiliary definitions we need and
     automatically performs the proofs. A crucial intermediate lemma
     we need in order to establish the last theorem is that the "___fuel"
     versions of the functions are monotonic in the fuel.
     More precisely:
     {[
       !n m. n <= m ==>
         (!ls i. even___P ls i n ==> even___fuel n ls i n = even___fuel m ls i n) /\
         (!ls i. odd___P ls i n ==> odd___fuel n ls i n = odd___fuel m ls i n)
     ]}
