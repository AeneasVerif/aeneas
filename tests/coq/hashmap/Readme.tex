\maketitle

[problem to solve (Coq backend for Aeneas functions, result)]

[high-level solution (open tactics with typeclasses)]

[structure (step/solve/simpl)]

[limitations \& TODOs]

We should have 3 high-level commands :

\begin{itemize}
\item "aeSimpl" which uniformises the context with a typeclass giving which hypotheses should be added, and simplifies the goal. It applies some directed equations which are for now hardcoded but should be given by another typeclass.
\item "aeSolve" which tries to solve the current goal. It's largely based on "lia" but also call some utilities such as "easy".
\item "aeStep" which progress on the current goal by reaching its head variable in some sense. For that, it lookup lemmas on the goal head variable from "MonadicLemma" and "ApplicableLemma".
\end{itemize}
