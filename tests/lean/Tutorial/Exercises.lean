/- # Notations

  You will need to type some special characters like `↑` or `∃`, `∧`, etc..

  In order to type the special characters, you need to type the character '\' then a
  specific string (note that typing an abbreviation often works, for instance "ex" instead
  of "exists"):
  - `↑` : \ + u    ("up")
  - `→` : \ + r    ("right")
  - `∧` : \ + and
  - `∨` : \ + or
  - `∀` : \ + forall
  - `∃` : \ + exists
-/

/- # Basic tactics -/

/- `simp` simplifies the goal by applying rewriting lemmas and simplifying definitions
   marked as `@[simp]`. For instance, the lemma `List.length_cons` which states that
   `(hd :: tl).length = tl.length + 1` has been marked as `simp`: -/
#check List.length_cons
example α (hd : α) (tl : List α) : (hd :: tl).length = tl.length + 1 := by
  -- This proves the goal automatically, by using `List.length_cons` above
  simp

/- You can see which lemmas are applied by `simp` by using `simp?`.
   This is often useful to build the intuition of what `simp` does, especially when
   it simplifies the goal a lot.

   Note that `simp [...]` allows you to specify additional rewriting lemmas to apply,
   and that `simp only` allows to forbid `simp` from applying any lemmas other than
   the ones you provide: this allows you to have quite fine-grained control on the
   simplifications

   There are ways of being even more precise, for instance by using conversions
   (https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/conv.html) and the `rw`
   tactic, but you will not need to understand those for this tutorial.

   Just be aware that `rw` doesn't apply simplification lemmas recursively, while
   `simp` repeatedly simplifies the goal until it can't make progress anymore.
 -/
example α (hd : α) (tl : List α) : (hd :: tl).length = tl.length + 1 := by
  simp? -- This prints: `simp only [List.length_cons]`

/- Your turn!

   Note that we give **tips and tricks** in the solutions: we advise to always have a look at them
   after you completed a proof.
 -/
example α (n : Nat) (x y : α) (l0 l1 l2 : List α)
  (h0 : l1 = x :: l0)
  (h1 : l2 = y :: l1)
  (h2 : l0.length = n) :
  l2.length = n + 2 := by
  sorry

/- The `simp` tactic is quite flexible: -/
example α (a b c d e : α) (h0 : a = b) (h1 : b = c) (h2 : c = d) (h3 : d = e) : a = e := by
  -- You can give (named) assumptions to `simp` instead of theorems
  simp [h0]
  -- You can simplify an assumption rather than the goal
  simp [h2, h3] at h1
  /- Note that you can simplify the goal *and* all the assumptions with `simp at *`.

     Similarly, you can simplify the goal by usoing all the assumptions in the context with
    `simp [*]`:
   -/
  simp [*]

/- The `simp_all` tactic is quite powerful: it repeatedly simplifies the assumptions
   and the goal by using the simp lemmas and the assumptions themselves.

   Note that it supports a syntax similar to `simp`: `simp_all only [...]`
 -/
example α (a b c d e : α) (h0 : a = b) (h1 : b = c) (h2 : c = d) (h3 : d = e) : a = e := by
  simp_all

/- You may want to prove intermediate goals: you can do so with `have`. -/
example (a b c : Prop) (h0 : a → b → c) (h1 : a) (h2 : b) : c := by
  have h3 : c := by simp_all
  -- If you omit the name, Lean will use the name `this`
  have : c := by simp_all
  -- You can also use an instantiated lemma/assumption with `have`:
  have _h4 := h0 h1 h2
  -- If your lemma/assumption has a precondition (i.e., if it is an implication)
  -- you can use the keyword `by` to prove it
  have := h0 (by simp [*]) (by simp [*])
  -- The `apply` tactic allows to apply a theorem or an assumption to the goal, if
  -- the conclusion of the assumption/theorem matches the goal (here, it allows us
  -- to finish the goal)
  apply this

/- As a side note, `simp` simplifies implications, equivalences, etc. so you
   can actually use it to prove the goal below. -/
example (a b c : Prop) (h0 : a → b → c) (h1 : a) (h2 : b) : c := by
  simp_all

/- Your turn! -/
example (a b c d : Prop) (h0 : a → b → c) (h1 : c → d → e)
  (ha : a) (hb : b) (hd : d) : e := by
  sorry

/- You can apply a simplification lemma the other way around: -/
example α (a b c : α) (h0 : a = b) (h1 : b = c) : a = c := by
  simp [← h1]
  simp [← h0]

/- To prove a goal of the shape `∀ x0 x1, ...` use `intro y0 y1 ...` to introduce
   the quantified variables in the context. -/
example α (p q : α → Prop) (h0 : ∀ x, p x) (h1 : ∀ x, p x → q x) : ∀ x, q x := by
  intro x
  have h2 := h0 x
  have h3 := h1 x h2
  apply h3

/- If the goal is an linear arithmetic goal, you can use `scalar_tac` to discharge it -/
example (x y z : Int) (h0 : x + y ≤ 3) (h1 : 2 * z ≤ 4) : x + y + z ≤ 5
  := by scalar_tac

/- Note that `scalar_tac` is aware of the bounds of the machine integers -/
example (x : U32) : 0 ≤ x.val ∧ x.val ≤ 2 ^ 32 - 1 := by scalar_tac

/- Renaming: note that the variables which appear in grey are variables which you can't
   reference directly, either because Lean automatically introduced fresh names for them,
   or because they are shadowed. You can use the `rename` and `rename_i` tactics to rename$
   them. -/
example α (p q r : α → Prop) (h : ∀ x, p x) (h : ∀ x, p x → q x) (h : ∀ x, q x → r x) :
  ∀ x, r x := by
  -- Rename all the unnamed variables/assumptions at once
  rename_i hp hpq
  -- The `rename` tactic allows to use a pattern to select the variable/assumption to rename
  rename ∀ (x : α), p x => h0
  rename ∀ (x : α), p x → q x => h1
  -- You can use holes in your pattern
  rename ∀ _, _ → _ => h2
  --
  simp_all

/- **Coercions**:
   The notation `↑` indicates a coercion. For instance:
   - if `x` is a machine scalar, `↑x : Int` desugars to `x.val`
   - if `v` is a vector (see exercises below), `↑v : List α` desugars to `v.val`

   Note that if you don't know what a **notation** which appears in the goal is exactly, just
   put your mouse over it.

   If you find coercions too confusing, you can set the option below to `false`.
   Note however that the goals will become significantly more verbose.
 -/
set_option pp.coercions true

/- # Reasoning about lists

   Small preparation for theorem `list_nth_mut1`.
 -/

/- Reasoning about `List.index`.

   You can use the following two lemmas.
 -/
#check List.getElem!_cons_zero
#check List.getElem!_cons_nzero

/- Example 1: indexing the first element of the list -/
example [Inhabited α] (i : U32) (hd : α) (tl : CList α)
  (hEq : i = 0#u32) :
  (hd :: tl.toList)[i.val]! = hd := by
  have hi : i.val = 0 := by scalar_tac
  simp only [hi]
  --
  have hIndex := @List.getElem!_cons_zero _ hd _ tl.toList
  simp only [hIndex]

/- Example 2: indexing in the tail -/
example [Inhabited α] (i : U32) (hd : α) (tl : CList α)
  (hEq : i ≠ 0#u32) :
  (hd :: tl.toList)[i.val]! = tl.toList[i.val - 1]! := by
  -- Note that `scalar_tac` is aware of `Arith.Nat.not_eq`
  have hIndex := List.getElem!_cons_nzero hd tl.toList i.val (by scalar_tac)
  simp only [hIndex]

/- Note that `List.index_zero_cons` and `List.index_cons_nzero` have been
   marked as `@[simp]` and are thus automatically applied. Also note
   that `simp` can automatically prove the premises of rewriting lemmas,
   if it has enough information.

   For this reason, `simp [*]` and `simp_all` can often do more work than
   you expect. -/
example [Inhabited α] (i : U32) (hd : α) (tl : CList α)
  (hEq : i = 0#u32) :
  (hd :: tl.toList)[i.val]! = hd := by
  simp [hEq]

/- Note that `simp_all` manages to automatically apply `List.index_cons_nzero` below,
   by using the fact that `i ≠ 0#u32`. -/
example [Inhabited α] (i : U32) (hd : α) (tl : CList α)
  (hEq : i ≠ 0#u32) :
  (hd :: tl.toList)[i.val]! = tl.toList[i.val - 1]! := by
  simp_all

/- Below, you will need to reason about `List.update`.
   You can use the following lemmas.

   Those lemmas have been marked as `@[simp]`, meaning that if `simp` is properly used,
   it will manage to apply them automatically.
 -/
#check List.set_cons_zero
#check List.set_cons_nzero

/- # Some proofs of programs -/

/-- Theorem about `list_nth_mut1`.

    **Hints**:
    - you can use `step` to automatically apply a lemma, then refine it into
      `step as ⟨ ... ⟩` to name the variables and the post-conditions(s) it introduces.
    - if there is a disjunction or branching (like an `if then else`) in the goal, use `split`
    - if the goal is a conjunction, you can use `split_conjs` to introduce one subgoal
      per disjunct
    - you should use `step` for as long as you see a monadic `do` block, unless you
      see a branching, in which case you should use `split`.

    **Remark**: we wrote two versions of the solution in `Solutions.lean`:
    - a verbose one, where we attempt to be precise with the simplifer and
      precisely instantiate the lemmas we need. This is for pedagogical
      purpose.
    - a simpler one, which is closer to what one would write in a real
      development

/-- You will need this lemma for the proof of `add_no_overflow_loop_spec`.

    Advice: do the proof of `add_no_overflow_loop_spec` first, then come back to prove this lemma.

    Hint: you will need to reason about non-linear arithmetic. You can use two tactics to do so:
    - `ring_nf`, `ring_nf at h`, `ring_nf at *`:
      normalizes (simplifies) the expressions of the shape `a ^ k * x + ... + b ^ k * y `
    - `ring_eq_nf`: similar, but tuned to prove goals of the shape: `... = ...`
    You can try both tactics and see their effect.

/-- You will need this lemma for the proof of `add_no_overflow_loop_spec`.

    Advice: do the proof of `add_no_overflow_loop_spec` first, then come back to prove this lemma.

    Remark: this proof is slightly technical and requires to control rewritings precisely (we
    haven't explained how to do that above) to prove at some point that (beware of the conversions
    between ℕ and ℤ!):
    `2 ^ (i * 32) = ((2 ^ ((i - 1) * 32) * 2 ^ 32 : Int)`

    We recommend that you keep this proof until the very end then:
    - either ask for help
    - or go see the solution
