# Raw Box extraction provenance

This log covers `RawBox.lean` only, not the other fixtures in this directory.

The executables were used read-only. Their compiler checkout/pair is newer than
the experiment's original base and `charon-pin`
(`de8736f7c995ac54dc490345cef9ea5143c06c62`). The latter was not changed; this run
does not attest that the compiler can be rebuilt with that older pin. The emitted
definitions use the redesigned backend's existing Box and raw-pointer wrappers.

```

Outcome: both public functions extracted without external stubs or axioms.
No generated definitions were edited. `RawBoxProofs.lean` is handwritten and
proves framed total-correctness contracts about those definitions, using
`HeapWP` and the fixed `layout` assumption.

Replay the Lean checks with `make verify-raw-box`. This uses the isolated backend
and temporary compiled fixture artifacts rather than populating a second Mathlib
build cache. The normal test Lake targets also include both modules.
