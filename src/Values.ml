          This is necessary for synthesis: upon translating to "pure" values,

          When evaluating a two-phase mutable borrow, we first introduce an inactivated
          borrow which behaves like a shared borrow, until the moment we actually *use*
          the borrow: at this point, we end all the other shared borrows (or inactivated

          is well typed) of this value and replace the inactivated borrow with a
          mutable borrow.
          
          A simple use case of two-phase borrows:
          ```
          let mut v = Vec::new();

          l = Vec::len(move v2);

          receive *several* (symbolic) given back values.
          
          This is the case in the following example:
          ```
          fn f<'a> (...) -> (&'a mut u32, &'a mut u32);

          This projector will later receive two given back values: one for
          'a and one for 'b.
          
          We accumulate those values in the list of projections (note that
          the meta value stores the value which was given back).

  | AIgnoredMutBorrow of BorrowId.id option * typed_avalue
      (** An ignored mutable borrow.
      
          We need to keep track of ignored mut borrows because when ending such
          borrows, we need to project the loans of the given back value to
          insert them in the proper abstractions.
          
          Note that we need to do so only for borrows consumed by parent
          abstractions (hence the optional borrow id).

          Example:
          ========
          ```
          fn f<'a,'b>(ppx : &'a mut &'b mut u32);

          Note that we could use AIgnoredMutLoan in the case the borrow id is not
          None, which would allow us to simplify the rules (to not have rules
          to specifically handle the case of AIgnoredMutBorrow with Some borrow
          id) and also remove the AEndedIgnoredMutBorrow variant.
          For now, the rules are implemented and it allows us to make the avalues
          more precise and clearer, so we will keep it that way.
   
          TODO: this is annoying, we are duplicating information. Maybe we
          could introduce an "Ignored" value? We have to pay attention to
          two things:
          - introducing ⊥ when ignoring a value is not always possible, because
            we check whether the borrowed value contains ⊥ when giving back a
            borrowed value (if it is the case we give back ⊥, otherwise we
            introduce a symbolic value). This is necessary when ending nested
            borrows with the same lifetime: when ending the inner borrow we
            actually give back a value, however when ending the outer borrow
            we need to give back ⊥.
            TODO: actually we don't do that anymore, we check if the borrowed
            avalue contains ended regions (which is cleaner and more robust).
          - we may need to remember the precise values given to the
            abstraction so that we can properly call the backward functions
            when generating the pure translation.

  | AEndedMutBorrow of msymbolic_value * typed_avalue
      (** The sole purpose of [AEndedMutBorrow] is to store the (symbolic) value

          We also remember the child [avalue] because this structural information
          is useful for the synthesis (but not for the symbolic execution):
          in practice the child value should only contain ended borrows, ignored
          values, bottom values, etc.

  | AProjSharedBorrow of abstract_shared_borrows
      (** A projected shared borrow.

          When giving shared borrows as arguments to function calls, we
          introduce new borrows to keep track of the fact that the function
          might reborrow values inside. Note that as shared values are immutable,
          we don't really need to remember the structure of the shared values.

          Example:
          ========
          Below, when calling `f`, we need to introduce one shared borrow per
          borrow in the argument.
          ```
          fn f<'a,'b>(pppx : &'a &'b &'c mut u32);

          > x    -> mut_loan l0
          > px   -> shared_loan {l1} (mut_borrow l0 (U32 0))
          > ppx  -> shared_loan {l2} (shared_borrow l1)
          > pppx -> shared_borrow l2

          f(move pppx);

          > x    -> mut_loan l0
          > px   -> shared_loan {l1, l3, l4} (mut_borrow l0 (U32 0))
          > ppx  -> shared_loan {l2} (shared_borrow l1)
          > pppx -> ⊥
          > abs'a { a_proj_shared_borrow {l2} }
          > abs'b { a_proj_shared_borrow {l3} } // l3 reborrows l1
          > abs'c { a_proj_shared_borrow {l4} } // l4 reborrows l0
