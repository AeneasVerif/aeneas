          If this meta information is for a statement/terminator coming from a macro

          to the macro).

          Ex:
          ```text
          // Below, we consider the spans for the statements inside `test`

          //   the statement we consider, which gets inlined in `test`
                                   VV
          macro_rules! macro { ... st ... } // `generated_from_span` refers to this location

          fn test() {
              macro!(); // <-- `span` refers to this location
          }
          ```
