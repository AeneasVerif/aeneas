    The matching functions are used for instance to compute joins, or to check
    if two contexts are equivalent (modulo conversion). *)

    - [explore]: this function is used to filter abstractions.

(** Generic functor to implement matching functions between values,
    environments, etc.

    We use it for joins, to check if two environments are convertible, etc. See
    for instance {!MakeJoinMatcher} and {!MakeCheckEquivMatcher}.

    The functor is parameterized by a
    {!module-type:InterpreterLoopsCore.PrimMatcher}, which implements the
    non-generic part of the match. More precisely, the role of
    {!module-type:InterpreterLoopsCore.PrimMatcher} is two provide generic
    functions which recursively match two values (by recursively matching the
    fields of ADT values for instance). When it does need to match values in a
    non-trivial manner (if two ADT values don't have the same variant for
    instance) it calls the corresponding specialized function from
    {!module-type:InterpreterLoopsCore.PrimMatcher}. *)
module MakeMatcher : functor (_ : PrimMatcher) -> Matcher

(** A matcher for joins (we use joins to compute loop fixed points).

    See the explanations for {!MakeMatcher}.

    In case of loop joins:
    - we match *concrete* values
    - we check that the "fixed" abstractions (the abstractions to be framed
    - i.e., the abstractions which are the same in the two environments to join)
      are equal
    - we keep the abstractions which are not in the frame, then merge those
      together (if they have borrows/loans in common) later The join matcher is
      used to match the *concrete* values only. For this reason, we fail on the
      functions which match avalues. *)
module MakeJoinMatcher : functor (_ : MatchJoinState) -> PrimMatcher

(** An auxiliary matcher that we use for two purposes:
    - to check if two contexts are equivalent modulo id substitution (i.e.,
      alpha equivalent) (see {!ctxs_are_equivalent}).
    - to compute a mapping between the borrows and the symbolic values in a
      target context to the values and borrows in a source context (see
      {!match_ctx_with_target}). *)
module MakeCheckEquivMatcher : functor (_ : MatchCheckEquivState) ->
  CheckEquivMatcher

(** Compute whether two contexts are equivalent modulo an identifier
    substitution.

    [fixed_ids]: ids for which we force the mapping to be the identity.

    We also take advantage of the structure of the environments, which should
    have the same prefixes (we check it). See the explanations for
    {!InterpreterLoopsJoinCtxs.join_ctxs}.

    TODO: explanations.

    The input parameters are:
    - [check_equiv]: if [true], check if the two contexts are equivalent. If
      [false], compute a mapping from the first context to the second context,
      in the sense of [match_ctx_with_target].

    - [fixed_ids]

    - [lookup_shared_value_in_ctx0], [lookup_shared_value_in_ctx1]: The lookup
      functions are used to match the shared values when [check_equiv] is
      [false] (we sometimes use [match_ctxs] on partial environments, meaning we
      have to lookup the shared values in the complete environment, otherwise we
      miss some mappings).

    - [ctx0]
    - [ctx1]

    We return an optional ids map: [Some] if the match succeeded, [None]
    otherwise. *)

(** Compute whether two contexts are equivalent modulo an identifier
    substitution.

    We also take advantage of the structure of the environments, which should
    have the same prefixes (we check it). See the explanations for
    {!InterpreterLoopsJoinCtxs.join_ctxs}.

    For instance, the following environments are equivalent:
    {[
      env0 = {
        abs@0 { ML l0 }
        ls -> MB l1 (s2 : loops::List<T>)
        i -> s1 : u32
        abs@1 { MB l0, ML l1 }
      }

      env1 = {
        abs@0 { ML l0 }
        ls -> MB l2 (s4 : loops::List<T>)
        i -> s3 : u32
        abs@2 { MB l0, ML l2 }
      }
    ]}

    We can go from [env0] to [env1] with the substitution:
    {[
      abs_id_subst: { abs@1 -> abs@2 }
      borrow_id_subst: { l1 -> l2 }
      symbolic_id_subst: { s1 -> s3, s2 -> s4 }
    ]}

    Parameters:
    - [fixed_ids]: ids for which we force the mapping to be the identity.
    - [ctx0]
    - [ctx1] *)
val ctxs_are_equivalent : Meta.span -> ids_sets -> eval_ctx -> eval_ctx -> bool

(** Reorganize a target context so that we can match it with a source context
    (remember that the source context is generally the fixed point context,
    which results from joins during which we ended the loans which were
    introduced during the loop iterations).

    - [config]
    - [loop_id]
    - [fixed_ids]
    - [src_ctx] *)
