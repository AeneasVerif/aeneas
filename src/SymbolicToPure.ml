(** Notice that we use the *injective* map to map identifiers to names.

    Of course, even if those names (which are string lists) don't collide,
    when converting them to strings we can still introduce collisions: we
    check that later.
    
    Note that we use injective maps for sanity: though we write the name
    generation with collision in mind, it is always good to have such checks.
