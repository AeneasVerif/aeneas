(** The Rust compiler generates a unique implementation of [Default] for arrays
    for every choice of length. For instance, if we write:
    {[
      let a: [u8; 32] = default ();
      let b: [u8; 64] = default ();
      ...
    ]}
    then rustc will introduce two different implementations of [Default]: an
    implementation for [u8; 32] and a different one for [u8; 64].

    For the purpose of the translation, we prefer using a single implementation
    which is generic in the length of the array. This pass thus replaces all the
    implementations of [Default<[T; N]>] with a single implementation.

    Concretely, we spot all the instances of [Default<[T; N]>] where [N] is a
    concrete array. We update the first such implementation so that it becomes
    generic in the length of the array, and replace all the other ones with this
    implementation. We also remove the useless implementations. *)

(** Remove the use of shallow borrows and the storage live/dead instructions.

    Storage live/dead instructions are not used by the symbolic/concrete
    interpreter, so we can safely remove them.

    Shallow borrows are used in early versions of MIR for the sole use of the
    borrow checker (they have no runtime semantics). They are used to prevent
    match guards from changing a discriminant that is being matched on.

    For instance, let's consider the following Rust code:
    {[
      let mut x = (true, true);
      match x {
          (false, _) => 1,
          (true, _) if { x.0 = false; false } => 0,
          (_, true) => 2,
          (true, _) => 3,
      }
    ]}

    If this code was allowed, it would reach an `unreachable_unchecked` code
    path. Rust disallows this by adding a shallow borrow of each place whose
    discriminant is read, and a fake (removed before codegen) read of that
    borrow.

    We discard these in Aeneas. This does allow more code to pass the
    borrow-checker, but the UB is still correctly caught by the
    evaluator/translation hence the translation is still sound. *)
