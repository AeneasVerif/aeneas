    the invariant, and the rule becomes: we can't end a borrow *if* it contains
    a bottom value. The consequence is that it becomes ok to temporarily
    have bottom below a borrow, if we put something else inside before ending
    the borrow.

    For instance, when evaluating an assignment, we move the value which
    will be overwritten then do some administrative tasks with the borrows,
    then move the rvalue to its destination. We currently want to be able
    to check the invariants every time we end a borrow/an abstraction,
    meaning at intermediate steps of the assignment where the invariants

(** Forbids using field projectors for structures.

    If we don't use field projectors, whenever we symbolically expand a structure
    value (note that accessing a structure field in the symbolic execution triggers
    its expansion), then instead of generating code like this:
    {[
       let x1 = s.f1 in
       let x2 = s.f2 in
       ...
    ]}

    we generate code like this:
    {[
       let Mkstruct x1 x2 ... = s in
       ...
    ]}

    Rem.: this used to be useful for Coq, because in Coq we can't define groups
    of mutually recursive records and inductives. In such cases, we extract
    the structures as inductives, which means that field projectors are not
    always available. As of today, we generate field projectors definitions
    (together with the appropriate notations).
