(** A binary operation

    Note that we merge checked binops and unchecked binops: we perform a
    micro-pass on the MIR AST to remove the assertions introduced by rustc,
    and later extract the binops which can fail (addition, substraction, etc.)
    or have preconditions (division, remainder...) to monadic functions.

(** Constant value for an operand

    It is a bit annoying, but rustc treats some ADT and tuple instances as
    constants when generating MIR:
    - an enumeration with one variant and no fields is a constant.
    - a structure with no field is a constant.
    - sometimes, Rust stores the initialization of an ADT as a constant
      (if all the fields are constant) rather than as an aggregated value

    For our translation, we use the following enumeration to encode those
    special cases in assignments. They are converted to "normal" values
    when evaluating the assignment (which is why we don't put them in the
    [ConstantValue] enumeration).
 *)

  | ConstantValue of constant_value

(* TODO: symplify the operand constant values *)
type operand =
  | Copy of place
  | Move of place
  | Constant of ety * operand_constant_value
[@@deriving show]

(** An aggregated ADT.

    Note that ADTs are desaggregated at some point in MIR. For instance, if
    we have in Rust:
    ```
    let ls = Cons(hd, tl);
    ```
    
    In MIR we have (yes, the discriminant update happens *at the end* for some
    reason):
    ```
    (ls as Cons).0 = move hd;
    (ls as Cons).1 = move tl;
    discriminant(ls) = 0; // assuming `Cons` is the variant of index 0
    ```
    
    Note that in our semantics, we handle both cases (in case of desaggregated
    initialization, `ls` is initialized to `⊥`, then this `⊥` is expanded to
    `Cons (⊥, ⊥)` upon the first assignment, at which point we can initialize
    the field 0, etc.).
